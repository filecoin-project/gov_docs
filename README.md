# Filecoin Governance Docs
A knowledge management hub for Filecoin governance documentation and best practices. 
Welcome to the knowledge base! This is a central repository of information, guidance, and resources related to our organization and its products or services. Our goal is to provide a single source of truth for all the information you need.
Governance at Filecoin is underpinned by the notion of community participation, shared vision of the growth of the network and collaboration. 
As the Filecoin network grows rapidly, community interest and interaction with governance processes peak hence requiring a one-stop-shop containing documentation, principles and materials for better engagement and understanding of governance procedures. 

To get started, you can use the search bar to look for specific topics or use the navigation menu to browse through the different categories. If you can't find what you're looking for, you can also request new content to be added to the knowledge base.

We encourage you to contribute to the knowledge base as well. If you have information that you think would be helpful to others, you can submit it for review by submitting a pull request.
